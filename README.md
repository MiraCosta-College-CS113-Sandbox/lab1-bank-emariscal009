# Lab #1 Bank  

The purpose of this lab is to review concepts from CS 111 Java 1 and CS 112 Java 2. You will be practicing reading from a UML Lab#1Bank.jpeg file and interpreting it to Java. Remember UML  (Unified Modeling Language), is a standardized modeling language consisting of an integrated set of diagrams, developed to help system and software developers for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems,

You will find all the java files for each class and Lab#1Bank.jpeg on the right side under Files. Note some of the files are already completed. You will be practicing creating classes with attributes and methods, inheritance, polymorphism, and association. The classes that need to be completed have comments to help complete the section.
